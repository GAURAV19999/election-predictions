## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Install necessary packages

The following code will install packages used in the project.

```{r}
#list of packages used
packages <- c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "class", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "neuralnet", "arules",
              "plyr", "mltools", "arulesViz", "plotly", "RCurl")

#check to see if package is already installed, if not, install
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(p)
    library(p, character.only = TRUE)
  } 
}
```
## Explore the demographics dataset

Import the data from my github page and explore.

```{r}
#import our county features dataset
path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/master/Data/county_facts.csv"
demographics <- read.csv(path, header=TRUE)

#See the structure of the dataset
names(demographics)
head(demographics)
str(demographics)

#find the state summary info and remove (want only counties, this dataset includes state summaries)
demographics <- demographics[-which(demographics$state_abbreviation == ""), ]
head(demographics)
```

## Add in Dictionary information

```{r}
#pull in dictionary to get true names of the variables
path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/master/Data/county_facts_dictionary.csv"
var_names <- read.csv(path, header = TRUE)

#view variable names
print(var_names)
```

## Pull in Election Results and Clean the data

```{r}
#add in the election results
path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianjeffries/election-predictions/master/Data/pres16results.csv"
election_results <- read.csv(path, header = TRUE)
head(election_results)

#drop columns we don't need
election_results <- election_results[-c(2, 5, 8)]
head(election_results)

#filter by the republican and democrat candidates & remove null values
ER_clean <- election_results %>%
                      filter(cand %in% c("Donald Trump", "Hillary Clinton") & county != "<NA>")
head(ER_clean)

#change to wide dataset to merge our candidate information into the features document
ER_clean <- spread(ER_clean, key = cand, value = votes)
head(ER_clean)

#add in % won by
ER_clean$Percent_Rep <- round(ER_clean$`Donald Trump` / ER_clean$total_votes, 2)
ER_clean$Percent_Dem <- round(ER_clean$`Hillary Clinton` / ER_clean$total_votes, 2)
head(ER_clean)
```
